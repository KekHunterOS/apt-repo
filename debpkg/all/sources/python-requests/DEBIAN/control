Description: elegant and simple HTTP library for Python2, built for human beings
 Requests allow you to send HTTP/1.1 requests. You can add headers, form data,
 multipart files, and parameters with simple Python dictionaries, and access
 the response data in the same way. It's powered by httplib and urllib3, but
 it does all the hard work and crazy hacks for you.
