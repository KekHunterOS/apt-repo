Description: manipulation of various common network address notations (Python 2)
 netaddr is a Python library for the manipulation of various common
 network address notations and representations.
 .
 It takes the hassle out of fiddling with enumerable variations of
 network addresses presenting a consistent, extensible, easy-to-use
 and (above all) Pythonic API.
 .
 With it you can validate, convert, categorise, iterate, generate,
 slice (and dice):
  - MAC (Media Access Control)
  - IEEE EUI-48 and EUI-64
  - IP version 4
  - IP version 6
  - CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
 .
 This is the Python 2 version of the package.
