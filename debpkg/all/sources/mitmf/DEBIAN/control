Description: Framework for Man-In-The-Middle attacks
 The program was created to deal with some of the significant shortcomings
 that Ettercap filters have when modifying HTTP traffic. It tries to provide
 an easily extensible Python interface for on-the-fly manipulation of HTTP
 traffic.
 .
 Currently, it has a number of helpful plugins that allow you to set
 up the MITM attack, inject arbitrary data into a session, launch browser
 attacks from Metasploit, and dynamically replace files with malicious
 versions. Available plugins:
 .
  - HTA Drive-By - Injects a fake update notification and prompts clients to
    download an HTA application
  - SMBTrap - Exploits the 'SMB Trap' vulnerability on connected clients
  - Screenshotter -  Uses HTML5 Canvas to render an accurate screenshot of a
    clients browser
  - Responder - LLMNR, NBT-NS and MDNS poisoner
  - SSLstrip+ - Partially bypass HSTS
  - Spoof - Redirect traffic using ARP, ICMP, DHCP or DNS Spoofing
  - BeEFAutorun - Autoruns BeEF modules based on client's OS or browser
    type
  - AppCachePoison - Perform HTML5 App-Cache poisoning attacks
  - Ferret-NG - Tranperently hijacks sessions
  - BrowserProfiler - Attempts to enumerate all browser plugins of connected
    clients
  - FilePwn - Backdoor executables being sent over http using the Backdoor
    Factory and BDFProxy
  - Inject - Inject arbitrary content into HTML content
  - BrowserSniper - Performs drive-by attacks on clients with out-of-date
    browser plugins
  - jskeylogger - Injects a javascript keylogger into clients webpages
  - Replace - Replace arbitrary content in HTML content
  - SMBAuth - Evoke SMB challenge-response auth attempts
  - Upsidedownternet - Flips images 180 degrees
