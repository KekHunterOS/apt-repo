Description: GPGPU-driven WPA/WPA2-PSK key cracker
 Pyrit allows one to create massive databases, pre-computing part of the
 WPA/WPA2-PSK authentication phase in a space-time-tradeoff. Exploiting the
 computational power of many-core- and other platforms through ATI-Stream,
 Nvidia CUDA, OpenCL, and VIA Padlock, it is currently by far the most powerful
 attack against one of the world's most used security-protocols.
 .
 This package contains the basic version of Pyrit, with support for MMX, SSE2
 and VIA PADLOCK detected at run-time. Support for the non-free technologies
 Nvidia CUDA, ATI-Stream, and OpenCL can be added through extensions. If
 packaged, these should be available in the contrib section with names in the
 form of "pyrit-*.
