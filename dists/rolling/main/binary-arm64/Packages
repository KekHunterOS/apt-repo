Description: Framework for Man-In-The-Middle attacks
 The program was created to deal with some of the significant shortcomings
 that Ettercap filters have when modifying HTTP traffic. It tries to provide
 an easily extensible Python interface for on-the-fly manipulation of HTTP
 traffic.
 .
 Currently, it has a number of helpful plugins that allow you to set
 up the MITM attack, inject arbitrary data into a session, launch browser
 attacks from Metasploit, and dynamically replace files with malicious
 versions. Available plugins:
 .
  - Responder - LLMNR, NBT-NS and MDNS poisoner
  - SSLstrip+ - Partially bypass HSTS
  - Spoof - Redirect traffic using ARP Spoofing, ICMP Redirects or DHCP
    Spoofing and modify DNS queries
  - BeEFAutorun - Autoruns BeEF modules based on clients OS or browser
    type
  - AppCachePoison - Perform app cache poison attacks
  - SessionHijacking - Performs session hijacking attacks, and stores cookies
    in a firefox profile
  - BrowserProfiler - Attempts to enumerate all browser plugins of connected
    clients
  - CacheKill - Kills page caching by modifying headers
  - FilePwn - Backdoor executables being sent over http using bdfactory
  - Inject - Inject arbitrary content into HTML content
  - JavaPwn - Performs drive-by attacks on clients with out-of-date java
    browser plugins
  - jskeylogger - Injects a javascript keylogger into clients webpages
  - Replace - Replace arbitrary content in HTML content
  - SMBAuth - Evoke SMB challenge-response auth attempts
  - Upsidedownternet - Flips images 180 degrees

Description: GPGPU-driven WPA/WPA2-PSK key cracker
 Pyrit allows one to create massive databases, pre-computing part of the
 WPA/WPA2-PSK authentication phase in a space-time-tradeoff. Exploiting the
 computational power of many-core- and other platforms through ATI-Stream,
 Nvidia CUDA, OpenCL, and VIA Padlock, it is currently by far the most powerful
 attack against one of the world's most used security-protocols.
 .
 This package contains the basic version of Pyrit, with support for MMX, SSE2
 and VIA PADLOCK detected at run-time. Support for the non-free technologies
 Nvidia CUDA, ATI-Stream, and OpenCL can be added through extensions. If
 packaged, these should be available in the contrib section with names in the
 form of "pyrit-*.

Description: Python bindings for nfqueue
 nfqueue-bindings is a set of high-level modules for several languages
 (Python and Perl, for the moment), for libnetfilter_queue.
 It provides a userspace API to access packets that have been queued by
 the kernel packet filter using the NFQUEUE target.
 .
 This package contains the Python bindings for nfqueue.
