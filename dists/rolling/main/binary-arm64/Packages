Description: Toolkit for rogue access point attacks
 The MANA toolkit was first presented at Debfconf 22 by Dominic White and Ian
 de Villiers. It's a toolkit to setup attacks based on rogue access points:

 .
 More specifically, it contains the improvements to KARMA attacks
 implemented into hostapd, as well as some useful configs for conducting MitM
 once you've managed to get a victim to connect.
 .
 You'll need a wifi card that supports master mode. You can check whether it
 does by running “iw list”. You want to see “AP” in the output.
